Script to remove the duplicate songs in rhythmbox.

I wrote this code to play around javascript and nodejs modules, i hope it would be useful for someone besides me.


# Preparation

1. Download app.js and package.json files.

2. If you have installed nodejs just run (in the same directory of app.js and package.json).

        $ npm install

   else, install [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/) and back to the step 2.

# Usage

    $ node app.js path_to_rhythmdb.xml

Usually the path to rhythmdb.xml is ~/.local/share/rhythmbox, but it
could change in some pc.

Then a file 'non\_rep.xml' will be created in your /tmp, copy it and replace your rhythmdb.xml (make a backup before if you want).

Enjoy :D
